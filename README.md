Simple alghoritms

This program presents 5 alghoritms:

1. 'Matrix' Add two matrices (String or int).

2. 'Minimum' Return the smallest positive number that List does not contain.

3. 'Substring' Return number of  A chain repetition to make B a substring A
    Ex.
    A = "abcd", B = "cdabcdab" => 3 - because 3 repeatings of A are needed to make "abcdabcdabcd" that contains B                                                          
    
4. 'Solution' Returns indexes of two elements from the board which sum up to given target.
    Ex.
    float[] arr = {2, 7, 11, 15};
    float target = 9;
    int[] res = solution(arr, target); // 0,1

5. 'TestSortTime' Test execution times for five sorting alghoritms, for three cases: optimistic, pessimistic and random numbres (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/).
